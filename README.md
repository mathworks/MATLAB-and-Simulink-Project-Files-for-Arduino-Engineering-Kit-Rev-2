# MATLAB-and-Simulink-Project-Files-for-Arduino-Engineering-Kit-Rev-2

This package includes the MATLAB and Simulink files used to program the three projects in the Arduino Engineering Kit Rev 2:

1. A drawing robot that takes a reference drawing and duplicates it on a whiteboard.
2. A webcam controlled rover that navigates between reference points and moves objects with its forklift
3. A self-balancing motorcycle that maneuvers itself on varying terrain and remains upright using a flywheel for balance

These files along with the associated online learning materials included with the Rev 2 kit guide users through the process of programming each project, teaching important engineering concepts along the way in areas such as controls, system modeling, image processing, and robotics.
